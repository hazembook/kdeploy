                    "Waqf" General Public License
                بسم الله الرّحمن الرّحيم

           In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful

                    "Waqf" General Public License 2.0
                              3 Muharram 1435

This is the informal English translation of Waqf General Public License.
Anything but the Arabic version of the license has no value except for
convenience of our English speaking users. When we talk about the License
we refer to the Arabic version, which is the only one we officially offer,
we will try our best to make other translation as accurate as possible but
because of the nature of human languages we use one single reference language.

Preamble

This document is the controlling agreement for the use of the material covered
by it, as it is considered to be the contract signed between the publisher
and the beneficiary, as each contract has its own rules and conditions. We see
that monopolistic agreements not only restrict the beneficiary but affect the
value of intellectual work, From a light to a mere commodity, where the
intellectual property right is owned by the first intellectual depositor. Our
vision for this property is limited to the moral form of the intellectual
work itself in accordance with the rules below, unlike the monopoly licenses
that place unfair restrictions that keep the second party weak and encouraged
to violate them as much as possible.

We have a different vision, we offer our work (like computer software) to
please Allah, and this is the pillar of this license which distinguish it from
proprietary licenses. Any other intention (like spreading knowledge or getting
profits) should be accomplished in ways that does not go against our primary
moral aim.

According to our beliefs (which we don't enforce on any one, and you may or
may not share it with us) that Islam certainly forbids monopoly and concealing
knowledge in general, and this comes from:

    1. The sound Hadith (saying of prophet Muhammad PBUH): "Who conceal any
       type of knowledge will be bridle with a bridle of fire on the Day of
       Resurrection."
    2. Islamic Jurisprudence has specified what can be owned, and the rules
       does not apply to ideas as it's not a bounded tangible object and almost
       all the terms of proprietary agreements fall in ruling of forbidden
       Gharar (a kind of fraud that use uncertainty to fool the customers)
    3. The laws of Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) have been perfected in the
       good centuries and no new rulings are allowed to be brought except for
       newly discovered things
    4. Concealing useful knowledge from those who need it impose damage to
       people for temporal gains to few individuals
    5. Even bringing interests to software publishers is not a valid excuse
       because there are some companies produce and publish software without
       owning them (proprietary software) and yet they gain profits
    6. The so call "Intellectual Proprietary" is all about giving owners the
       right to forbid what Allah had made lawful to gain money

We in Waqf (as in many anti-monopoly licenses) are concerned with the interest
of the general public over its counterpart of those who glorify self-interest.
